DragonProxy Server Plugin
=========================

This is an optional plugin which may enhance your experience with DragonProxy. It also provides an API to communicate with the proxy.

This is, however, completely *optional*, and DragonProxy will work fine without it.

### Supported Servers
* Spigot
* Bungeecord

Note: If you install one of these plugins, you still need to run DragonProxy seperatly! This plugin just acts as a bridge between the served and proxy, it is NOT a proxy itself!
