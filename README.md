A proxy for to allow **Minecraft: Bedrock** clients to connect to **Minecraft: Java Edition** servers.

### What is DragonProxy
DragonProxy is a software placed between a Minecraft Bedrock client and a Java Minecraft server.
  
DragonProxy is __NOT a plugin__, __NOT a server__ like Spigot or Bungeecord, it's __NOT a BOT__, __NOT a CHEAT__ (it's sometimes buggy but we are working on this).
  
__Some servers anticheats trigger some movments cheat, use at your own risks.__
If you get banned from a server, we do not take responsabilities.
  
## Features
- Currently supporting Bedrock 1.2.10 and Java 1.12.2
- Chat supported
- Chunks supported
- Movement supported
- Block break / place supported
- Entities spawn move and equipment

## Known bugs

## Windows 10 localhost problem
If you try to run DragonProxy on the __same computer__ you start Minecraft W10 Edition, you must [enable loopback for Minecraft protocol first](http://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html).
