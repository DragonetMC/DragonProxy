## Compiling
You will need Java 8 JDK. You can download this from oracle's website or from your operating systems package manager.

You will also need Maven, which you can download from [here](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Then make sure maven is in your `PATH` (theres plenty of tutorials online).

#### Windows
Install [git scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and run `git clone https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy`

Then run `cd DragonProxy` and `mvn package`.

If all goes well, the DragonProxy jar can be found in `proxy\target`. Enjoy!

#### Linux
Install `git` and run `git clone https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy`

Then run `cd DragonProxy` and `mvn package`.

If all goes well, the DragonProxy jar can be found in `proxy/target`. Enjoy!

## Installing
Download in a sepate directory, then:
 - to generate a config file, start with ```java -jar dragonproxy-x.x.x.jar``` (where x.x.x is the version)
 - stop the process with CTRL+C
 - edit [config.yml](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/blob/master/proxy/src/main/resources/config.yml) as needed
 - then start again

## Plugin setup
[DragonProxy plugins](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/tree/master/plugin) are optionnals. Warning : the hybrid auth is only implemented for bungeecord.

The [bungeecord](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/tree/master/plugin/bungee) plugin is used to auth players in hybrid auth mode.

The [bukkit](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/tree/master/plugin/spigot) plugin is used to send custom packets to the Bedrock client, but does not works yet.

## Windows 10 localhost problem
If you try to run DragonProxy on the __same computer__ you start Minecraft W10 Edition, you must [enable loopback for Minecraft protocol](http://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html) first. **In the next release of DragonNet, this will no longer need to be done manually as the needed changes will be done through the code automatically. But for now, this section will stay until a release that does this on it's own is rolled out.**

## Libraries used

## Plugin developement (DragonProxy plugins)
A frenchy did a small plugin in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1_LASKNkFJtc2q46yvD35EvraArSrICh)
