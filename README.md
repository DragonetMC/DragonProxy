# DragonProxy [[DONATE](http://dragonet.org/donate.php)]

A proxy for **Minecraft - Pocket Edition** that allows connecting to **Minecraft PC** servers.

## Installation
DragonProxy is not currently suitable for end users.

## Compiling
See the tutorial in the [wiki](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/wiki).
Note: Maven won't build the project because every class in DragonProxy/DragonProxy/src/main/java/org/dragonet/proxy/network/translator/pe and DragonProxy/DragonProxy/src/main/java/org/dragonet/proxy/network/translator/pc has compile errors. Just move these folders out of the project to fix the problem until the translators are updated

#### Supported Remote Server Types
- For PC/Mac Servers: `Bukkit`/`Spigot`/`Glowstone`/`SpongeVanilla`/`BungeeCord`
- Not listed does **not** mean unsupported, just **untested**.
