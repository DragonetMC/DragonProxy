A proxy for to allow **Minecraft: Bedrock** clients to connect to **Minecraft: Java Edition** servers.

### What is DragonProxy
DragonProxy is a software placed between a Minecraft Bedrock client and a Java Minecraft server.

DragonProxy is __NOT a plugin__, __NOT a server__ like Spigot or Bungeecord, it's __NOT a BOT__, __NOT a CHEAT__ (it's sometimes buggy but we are working on this).

__Some servers anticheats trigger some movments cheat, use at your own risks.__
If you get banned from a server, we do not take responsabilities.

## Compiling
 - clone from github
 - execute ```mvn package``` in root project dir

## Starting
 - to generate a config file, start with ```java -jar dragonproxy-x.x.x.jar``` (where x.x.x is the version)
 - stop the process with CTRL+C
 - edit [config.yml](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy/blob/master/proxy/src/main/resources/config.yml) as needed
 - then start again

## Plugin setup
DragonProxy plugins are optionnals. Warning : the hybrid auth is only implemented for bungeecord.

The bungeecord plugin is used to auth players in hybrid auth mode.

The bukkit plugin is used to send custom packets to the Bedrock client.

## Windows 10 localhost problem
If you try to run DragonProxy on the __same computer__ you start Minecraft W10 Edition, you must [enable loopback for Minecraft protocol](http://pmmp.readthedocs.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html) first.
